                        <h3>Fake_news_detection: </h3>
                    </a>
                    <p>March 2023</p>
                    <p>In this project, a classifier is developed using Logistic Regression Model to predict whether a
                        given
                        news is fake or real . Here the classifier is trained to classify whether a given news is fake
                        (output = 1)
                        or real (output = 0). The entire programming is done in Google Collab platform .</p>

                    <p>May 2023</p>
                    <p>In this project , I have created a Memory Game using HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT. The game logic
                        is implemented using JavaScript. JavaScript is used to control the flipping of the cards, the
                        matching
                        of the cards, and the scoring. Basically I used Fisher Yates Algorithm behind this game. In this
                        game
                        there is a timer and as well as total flip count through which you can evaluate your performance
                        . I
                        hosted this game on GITHUB.</p>

                    <p>March 2023</p>
                    <p>In this project a cutting-edge obstacle detector circuit utilizing state of art proximity sensor technology.
                        Designed to detect objects in a close proximity , the circuit triggers an alert preventing potential
                        collisions and ensuring maximum safety . This project showcased advanced skills in analog electronics
                        and circuit design, coupled with a keen ability to troubleshoot and overcome technical challenges .</p>
